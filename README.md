📚 Library
A digital bookshelf app I made for The Odin Project! Users can add, delete, and update books, mark them as finished or in progress, and track their reading stats: all stored neatly in localStorage.

✨ What’s inside

Add, edit, and remove books with an easy interface

Track reading status: finished 📖 or in progress ⏳

View simple reading stats for progress motivation

Data saved by localStorage
